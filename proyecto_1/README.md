# RASM Interpolation

RASM Interpolation is a school project to implement bilineal interpolation in x86 ASM through a Rust interface.

## Usage

If running with cargo there's an alias `cargo rr` for running in release mode and being able to immediately specify options, for example:
```
cargo rr -i <input image>
```

There's also an alias to compile with slightly less optimizations that's still fast enough to be usable `cargo rf`, it should shorten the compilation time.
```
cargo rf -i <input image>
```

To look at all the available options pass the `-h` or `--help` flag:
```
cargo rf --help
```

Of course if simply executing from the executable replace the cargo command with the executables name:
```
rasm_interpolation --help
```


### Advanced usage example

This is an example where instead of a 4x4 grid you desire a 6x6 grid, you wish to store the input's grayscale version, save the output and specify a name for the intermediate file generated by the ASM function:
```
cargo rf -i input.jpg -g input.png -m result.img -o result.png
```

There's actually a cargo alias defined to execute this exact command, `cargo def`.
